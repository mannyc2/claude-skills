  BAD SCRIPT EXAMPLE
  
  This demonstrates common mistakes in video planning.
  Each mistake is marked with [MISTAKE] comments explaining what's wrong.
  
  This script would produce a video where:
  - The key feature (passkey auth) flashes by in 1.3 seconds
  - Viewer can't read explanatory text
  - Success feels like a glitch, not a payoff
  - No one understands what makes this different from normal wallets

  <metadata>
    <title>Passkey Wallet</title>
    
    <!-- [MISTAKE: No purpose statement]
         Without knowing WHY this video exists, there's no guide for 
         timing decisions. Is it a quick demo? A feature explanation? 
         Marketing material? Each needs different pacing. -->

    <!-- [MISTAKE: No viewer_takeaway]
         The most important field is missing. Without knowing what the 
         viewer should think after watching, we can't prioritize scenes.
         
         Result: All scenes get equal-ish time instead of emphasizing 
         the key differentiator. -->

  <scenes>
    <scene id="1">
      <n>UI</n>
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: Generic name, no narrative]
           "UI" tells us nothing. What should the viewer UNDERSTAND 
           from this scene? What makes it notable?
           
           Without narrative context, implementer will just "show the UI" 
           without understanding what matters. -->
      
      <viewer_should_notice>
        - Button
        - Card
      </viewer_should_notice>
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: Useless viewer_should_notice]
           "Button" and "Card" are implementation details, not viewer 
           insights. What should the viewer NOTICE? What's the signal?
           
           Missing: the ABSENCE of seed phrase warnings, which is the 
           whole point. -->
      
      <timing_intent>brief</timing_intent>
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: Wrong timing intent]
           "brief" (1-2s) doesn't give time to:
           - Read the headline
           - See the feature badges
           - Register what kind of screen this is
           
           The viewer will see a blur and then it's gone. -->
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: No timing_rationale]
           Without justification, "brief" is arbitrary. WHY brief?
           What can be skipped? Nothing - this is context-setting. -->
    </scene>

    <scene id="2">
      <n>Biometric</n>
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: Generic name]
           "Biometric" is a technical term. The scene is about 
           PASSWORDLESS SECURITY and REPLACING SEED PHRASES.
           
           Name affects how seriously implementer treats the scene. -->
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: No narrative at all]
           This is THE KEY DIFFERENTIATOR and it has no explanation 
           of what the viewer should understand.
           
           Result: Implementer treats it as "just another state" 
           instead of the hero moment. -->
      
      <timing_intent>standard</timing_intent>
      
      <!-- [CRITICAL MISTAKE: Hero moment marked as "standard"]
           This gives the KEY FEATURE only 2-4 seconds.
           
           Original buggy code gave this 40 frames = 1.3 seconds.
           At 1.3s, viewer sees:
           - Dialog appears (0.3s)
           - Text they can't read (0.5s)
           - Animation blur (0.3s)
           - Gone (0.2s)
           
           The ENTIRE POINT of the video is lost. -->
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: No minimum_duration_seconds]
           Without a hard floor, implementation can compress this 
           to whatever "feels right" - which is always too short. -->
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: No timing_rationale]
           If forced to justify "2-4 seconds" for the key feature, 
           the author would realize it's insufficient. -->
    </scene>

    <scene id="3">
      <n>Success</n>
      
      <timing_intent>brief</timing_intent>
      
      <!-- [MISTAKE: Success state marked "brief"]
           "brief" = 1-2 seconds for the PAYOFF moment.
           
           Result: Success flashes and video ends abruptly.
           Viewer feels like video glitched or cut off early.
           No emotional satisfaction of "that was easy."
           
           Success states need 2-3s minimum to register as 
           intentional completion, not accidental truncation. -->
    </scene>
  </scenes>

  <!-- [MISTAKE: No transitions defined]
       Without explicit transitions:
       - Cursor might stay visible during biometric (looks wrong)
       - Fade timing is arbitrary
       - Transitions might eat into scene time unexpectedly
       
       Example: If scene 2 is 3s and we add a 1s fade, scene 2 
       is really only 2s of content. -->

  WHAT THIS BAD SCRIPT PRODUCES:
  
  Timeline (what actually happened in the buggy code):
  
  TIMELINE = {
    BUTTON_CLICK: 40,        // 1.33s
    BIOMETRIC_SHOW: 50,      // 1.67s  
    BIOMETRIC_SUCCESS: 110,  // 3.67s  <- Only 2s for entire auth flow!
    WALLET_SHOW: 130,        // 4.33s
    ...
  };
  
  Problems:
  1. Biometric scene: 110 - 50 = 60 frames = 2 seconds
     - But this includes: appear, scan animation, success
     - Each sub-state gets ~0.7 seconds
     - Viewer can't read "Creating secure passkey..."
  
  2. No timing_rationale means no one caught this in planning
  
  3. "standard" timing intent didn't flag this as needing emphasis
  
  4. Success at frame 130 with total 360 = success is 8% of video
     - Should be at least 25% (3s of 12s)
  
  
  HOW TO FIX:
  
  1. Add viewer_takeaway to force thinking about purpose
  2. Mark scene 2 as timing_intent="hero" 
  3. Add minimum_duration_seconds=6 for hero scene
  4. Write timing_rationale justifying each duration
  5. Define transitions with explicit frame counts
  6. Write narrative explaining what viewer should understand
