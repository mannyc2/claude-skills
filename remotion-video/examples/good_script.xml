  GOOD SCRIPT EXAMPLE
  
  This demonstrates proper video planning for a passkey wallet creation flow.
  Key characteristics:
  - Clear viewer_takeaway driving all decisions
  - Hero moment gets majority of time
  - Every scene has timing_rationale justifying duration
  - Transitions explicitly defined

    <title>Passkey Wallet Creation</title>
    <purpose>
      Demonstrate that passkey wallets replace seed phrase anxiety with 
      device biometrics. Show the complete flow from button click to 
      usable wallet in seconds.
    </purpose>
    <target_duration_seconds>12</target_duration_seconds>
    <fps>30</fps>
    <viewer_takeaway>
      "I can create a crypto wallet with just my fingerprint - no seed 
      phrases to write down, memorize, or lose."
    </viewer_takeaway>
  </metadata>

  <scenes>
    <scene id="1">
      <name>Wallet Creation UI</name>
      <narrative>
        Clean interface appears. The key signal: NO seed phrase warning 
        anywhere. Traditional crypto onboarding starts with "write down 
        these 12 words" anxiety. This UI deliberately omits that, 
        signaling "this is different."
      </narrative>
      <viewer_should_notice>
        - "Create Wallet" button is the clear, single call-to-action
        - Feature badges: "Passkey secured", "Instant setup", "Self-custody"
        - Absence of seed phrase / recovery key mentions
        - Clean, trustworthy design language
      </viewer_should_notice>
      <timing_intent>standard</timing_intent>
      <timing_rationale>
        Viewer needs to:
        - Read headline "Create Your Wallet" (1s)
        - Scan the 3 feature badges (1.5s)
        - Register this as a wallet creation screen (0.5s)
        Total: 3 seconds. Not the hero moment, but needs enough time
        to establish context before the key differentiator.
      </timing_rationale>
    </scene>

    <scene id="2">
      <name>Passkey Authentication</name>
      <narrative>
        THIS IS THE HERO MOMENT. The entire point of the video.
        
        Native OS biometric prompt appears - this is TouchID/FaceID, not 
        a custom UI. The viewer must understand that device-level security 
        is handling authentication. The "Creating secure passkey..." text 
        explains what's happening.
        
        This scene replaces what would be 2-3 minutes of seed phrase 
        ceremony in traditional flows.
      </narrative>
      <viewer_should_notice>
        - Native system dialog (not app UI) - proves this is real device security
        - "Creating secure passkey..." explanatory text
        - Fingerprint scanning animation - something is happening
        - Success checkmark - confirmation it worked
        - The ENTIRE security setup is just this - no backup steps follow
      </viewer_should_notice>
      <timing_intent>hero</timing_intent>
      <timing_rationale>
        This is the key differentiator. Rushing it defeats the video's purpose.
        Viewer needs:
        1. Recognize the biometric prompt as system-level (1s)
           - If too fast, looks like a custom modal, not real security
        2. Read "Creating secure passkey..." (1.5s)
           - This text explains what's happening
        3. Watch scanning animation (2s)
           - Proves work is happening, builds anticipation
        4. See and register success state (1.5s)
           - Must feel like completion, not a flash
        
        Total: 6 seconds MINIMUM.
        
        Giving this less time is the #1 mistake - the viewer won't 
        understand what makes this special.
      </timing_rationale>
      <minimum_duration_seconds>6</minimum_duration_seconds>
    </scene>

    <scene id="3">
      <name>Wallet Ready</name>
      <narrative>
        Payoff: wallet exists and has an address. The viewer should feel 
        "wow, that's it? That was easy."
        
        Implicit comparison: traditional flow would have taken 5 minutes 
        of careful word transcription. This took 10 seconds.
      </narrative>
      <viewer_should_notice>
        - Success checkmark animation
        - "Wallet Created!" confirmation headline
        - Actual wallet address displayed (proof it worked)
        - Implicit: ready to receive funds immediately, no more steps
      </viewer_should_notice>
      <timing_intent>standard</timing_intent>
      <timing_rationale>
        Let the success moment breathe. This is emotional payoff.
        - Success animation registers (0.5s)
        - Read "Wallet Created!" (0.5s)
        - See wallet address as proof (1s)
        - Moment to feel "that was easy" (1s)
        
        Total: 3 seconds. Don't rush the ending - it's the lasting impression.

  <transitions>
    <transition from="1" to="2">
      <type>action</type>
      <trigger>Cursor clicks "Create Wallet" button</trigger>
      <description>
        Button shows press state (scale down slightly), then biometric 
        dialog fades in as button click triggers the system prompt.
        Cursor hides after click - user is not controlling the biometric.

        Biometric dialog fades out while success card slides up from below.
        Overlapping fade creates smooth handoff.
